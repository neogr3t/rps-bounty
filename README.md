It aims to provide an engaging, user-friendly experience that introduces players to decentralized applications and smart contract interactions in a fun and familiar context.

## Objectives

1. Showcase the capabilities of the Aptos blockchain for gaming applications
2. Implement a secure and transparent gaming mechanism using smart contracts
3. Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for seamless interaction
4. Demonstrate the integration of blockchain wallets with web applications
5. Provide a practical example of on-chain data storage and retrieval

## Key Features
